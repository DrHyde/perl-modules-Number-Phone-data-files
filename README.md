These are data files used to build [Number::Phone](https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/),
they are here solely to make CI builds more reliable by not having them blow chunks if they can't talk
to some telecoms regulators to get data files.

They are of no use to you whatsoever except if you want to hack on Number::Phone, and even then you shouldn't
need to touch them yourself, you can just use the build script.
